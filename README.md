# stock-ml-pipeline
A Machine learning python project that downloads stock data, creates useful features like moving averages, and trains a model to predict the next 30-day return. It then ranks stocks by those predictions and shows charts to help understand patterns. Future plan is to add backtesting, automation, and maybe a web dashboard.
